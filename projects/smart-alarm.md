Smart Alarm
-----------
###Background
Users often set their alarm clocks expecting their morning routine and commute to take the usual amount of time. However, life is not always so static. Oftentimes there are unexpected accidents or events that causes delays and mess up these morning plans. If an alarm is not smart enough to warn us ahead of time and wake us up earlier when these events occur, our mornings can be ruined.

###Challenge
We propose to create an alarm app that will periodically check your morning commute and estimate the amount of time your commute will take and wake you up with enough time to make your appointments.
