# Daily Kitten

### Background

According to an Indiana University researcher, Media professor Jessica Gall Myrick surveyed around 7,000 people and discovered that watching online cat images increased their energy and positive emotion. Hundreds of thousands cat images posted on Twitter with around millions views per day adds up to an amazing lot of time watching funny cats. However, people don't have an easy access to aggregated cat media information. Our platform aims to provide users an easy way to explore and support their favourite cat images and a daily subscription of popular cats on Twitter.

### Challenge

The challenge of our project is how to rank cats images. There are some factors to take into account, retweet count, favrourite count, upvotes and create time. How to generate a rank formula using these variables and tuning parameters is very tricky. In addition, another challenge is to build a automated system to recognize cat images and filter out outliers.
