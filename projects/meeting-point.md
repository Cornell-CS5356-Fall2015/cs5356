Meeting Point Compass
--------------------

### Background

At large events with crowds of people, it's really hard to find your group of friends, especially if you're unfamiliar with the area. Sometimes saying meet at the large tree next to the fountain just doesn't cut it. Calling someone on the phone to give directions is still harder than visually seeing where you are in relation to your friends.

### Challenge

We propose to create an application where your group can pin a location on a map. Anyone in that group would send real-time GPS coordinates that would designate where you are on the map. Watch as everyone from the group converges to that one point or know which friend is lost.
