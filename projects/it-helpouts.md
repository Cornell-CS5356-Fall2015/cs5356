IT Helpouts
--------------

### Background

As technology becomes more pervasive in our lives, it becomes more and more difficult to troubleshoot every small issue that comes up. On the other hand, there is a plethora of people with the knowledge to solve these issues that are completely underutilized. From full time IT to the student with extra time between classes, these people can serve a market greater than their gadget unaware family members.

### Challenge

Create a sleek mobile site and app that allows users to subscribe for technical support for all of their gadgets. Professionals are then able to register onto the system and resolve any issues on the queue they can handle.

### Further Consideration

We need to work out a reliable payment model. We need to be able to verify professionals, endorse their skills, and create stratified levels of support. There needs to reliable help and escalation ability to solve issues with reliable times.
