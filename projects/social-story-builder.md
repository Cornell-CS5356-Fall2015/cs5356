Social Story Builder
--------------------

### Background

Social stories are an educational tool used by teachers of developmentally disabled individuals. They are visual guides that describe social situations and behaviors. Social stories can be used to teach autistic individuals about social cues and how to react to various situations. They are a common intervention option for children and can explain social situations in a manner that is easily understood by its audience. Currently, social stories are generally created in a Word document and printed out.

### Challenge

Create a web application that would allow teachers, therapists, or parents to create social stories for a student. This would include an editor for uploading pictures and adding text. We also want to create a way for teachers to upload their social stories to a global community so that others could download their stories and edit it for their own students. There would also be a mobile component where a teacher could bring up the social story on a tablet and go through it with the student.
