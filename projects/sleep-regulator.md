Sleep Tracker
--------------------

### Background

Sleep is essential to human beings' daily functioning. A good night's sleep helps us to get through a busy day, to handle that challenging problem, to run that extra mile, and to think clearly. Everyone varies in the amount of sleep they need on a day to day, and there is nothing worse than a poor night sleep. Fatigue can lead to a degradation in performance mentally and physically, and to a negative emotional state. To maximize daily functioning, a person must optimize his or her night sleep.

### Challenge

The challenge is to develop an application that will enable the user to regulate his/her sleep based on the number of hours he or she wants or needs. The application will require two inputs: the number of sleep hours and the latest time the user wants to be woken up at. "Sleep App" will leverage  sleep detection technology(i.e jawbone etc..) to recognize the exact time the body shuts down (goes to sleep) and sets an alarm based on the inputs.

There are two major features that differentiate our idea from any other sleep/alarm application in the market:

1. Our sleep application wakes a user based on the number of hours of sleep he or she desires, rather than a concrete time to wake up (like most alarm clocks). However, the application also takes into account the latest the user wants/can wake up by.

2. Our app counts sleep from the moment the body falls asleep, and thus is a more accurate account of a person's sleep.

### Further Ideas

As a second phase, we would like to take into account any wakefulness in the middle of the night and automatically add extra time to compensate for this lost sleep. 
As a third phase, we would like to wake individuals when they are in their lightest sleep after they have reached a target amount of sleep or have reached a wake up deadline.
