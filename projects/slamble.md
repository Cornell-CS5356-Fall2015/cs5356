Slamble
--------------------

### Background

Sleep is essential to human beings' daily functioning. A good night's sleep helps us to get through a busy day, to handle that challenging problem, to run that extra mile, and to think clearly. Everyone varies in the amount of sleep they need on a day to day, and there is nothing worse than a poor night sleep. Fatigue can lead to a degradation in performance mentally and physically, and to a negative emotional state. To maximize daily functioning, a person must optimize his or her night sleep.

### Challenge

The challenge is to develop an application that will incentivize the user to sleep more. The application will gameify the modern alarm, by allowing users to bet their friends an amount to sleep. Users who accept a bet and meet the sleep goal earn points, while users who accept a bet and do not meet the sleep goal lose points. "Slamble" will leverage  sleep detection technology(i.e jawbone, accelerometor etc..) to track how long a user actually sleeps, ensuring validity in the user bet, and preventing cheating. Our app is different than all other sleep regulation apps out there in that it creates a game out of the modern alarm. Current apps track the amount and quality a person sleeps, but do not incentivize the user to reverse these trends. 

### Further Ideas

A second phase, will expand the social network, allowing users to maintain a network of friends. 
A third phase, will leverage a bet feed so that users can see bets that have been made in their network of friends.
