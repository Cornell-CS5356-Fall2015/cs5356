This project has already been started by a small group of folks who I worked with in Ithaca. We're very early in the development so anyone we'd love help if any of the challenges bellow can get you excited.

### Background

Create a market place for finding, linking and downloading data that scientists and researchers need to answer questions.

### Challenge

Design an SDK that can turn a database into an API. Design real time analytics dashboard for data sets currently in the system. Design a mechanism to securely exchange and link data without sharing identifiable information.
