# Game Master

### Background

Normally, big competition will take a lot of time from the host for preparation for arranging the match schedule and publishing the result. We want to save their time and make game-hosting a super easy thing to do.

### Challenge

We want to play a middle role between actuall game and the host, providing a universial interface for different kinds of games from actuall sports to video games. To do it, we are going to build a system that could host competitive games with any possible schedule. It will be intergrated with apps like calendar and may cooperate with other game host site or app. 

We will record, with users' permission, the final result and possible data as much as possible. We may do datamining on what we collect and also, may build APIs for these data.
