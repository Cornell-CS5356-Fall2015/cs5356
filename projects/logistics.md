Your Startup Project
--------------------

### Introduction

Students collaborate on an ambitious software project, a technology startup, from start to finish during the semester.

### Submitting Deliverables

The following schedule lists a few intermediate deliverables.  Add them to your project page and submit a pull request before Friday the week they are due. Each deliverable is worth 1 point towards your final grade.

Your First Story and MVP proposals should be added to a project management system linked from the project page, and you should include a link to your First Story demo and your Investor Pitch presentation and demo.

### Important Dates

#### 26-Aug: Introduction to Building Your Startup

Students hear an introduction to building startup technology and have a week to think about a project, either pick one from [existing projects](/README.md) or suggest their own. The criteria for new projects is that it must address a *broad market* and have potential for a very small *minimal viable product* that can be built in a few weeks.

#### 02-Sep: Deadline and Elevator Pitch for New Project Ideas

If you have another project idea, contribute the project description to this repository, see [CONTRIBUTING](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

Either way, you must prepare a 30 second elevator pitch for the project in front of the class. If your project is new, you will get to pitch it. If it's not, a lottery will decide whether you pitch it.

#### 09-Sep: Deadline for Groups Being Formed

Students can do a project individually or in groups. Each group must have a maximum of 3 students. Each student's name appears next to a project.

##### Deliverables:

* A project page.

#### 16-Sep: Deadline for a First Story

A first story is something useful that you can implement in a week. Students work with TAs and instructors on the definition of such a story, but don't need to implement it quite yet.

##### Deliverables:

* A story in a project management tool.
* Project management tool linked from the project page.

#### 23-Sep: Demo a First Story and Discuss MVP

Students demonstrate a working product that implements the first story in front of class and discuss an MVP, a minimal viable product that delivers value to the user. This discussion happens 1:1 with an instructor in which the student(s) describe a possible MVP, get feedback and come out with a better idea of what to build towards.

##### Deliverables:

* A working demo of the first story.

#### 30-Sep: Developer Infrastructure

Students spend time wrapping up the first story.

##### Deliverables:

* A source code repository.
* Code for the first story with automated tests.

#### 7-Oct: Deployed Software

Students deliver working software.

##### Deliverables:

* A clear project README that explains what the project is.
* Continuous integration with a badge that shows that the latest build passed/failed.
* Continuous deployment to the cloud for websites and a test store for apps that happens automatically with every successful build.

#### 14-Oct: MVP Progress and Alpha Users

Students enroll a student that is not part of their team to demonstrate progress towards an MVP in front of the class.

##### Deliverables:

* Convince and have another student present for you.
* Show an implementation of a second story with automated tests.


#### 3-Dec through 10-Dec: Project Grading Interviews

##### Goals
* The goal of the interview is to assess your project and give you as many points as possible
* Points can be awarded according to the the [project evaluation rubric](/course/logistics.md#grading).
* Only working software can contribute to your score

##### Preparation
* You should be prepared to show you accomplishments and help the graders classify your accomplishments according to the rubric
* Quickly establish shared understanding with the graders of what your project does
* Then show the graders the code that drives your project
* Ideally for each category you can describe the high-level architecture you have chosen
* Then you can show code, consistent with the architecture described, that makes your product work

##### Scheduling
* Sign up using the `#project_interviews` slack channel
* Request one contiguous block of time
* Requests take the form `Team Name | Number of Team Members | Start Time | Number of Minutes`
* If you are a team of 1, sign up for a 20-minute slot.
* If you are a team of 2 or more, sign up for a contiguous block of 20m + 10m per person (so 2 ppl == 40m)

##### Interview Agenda
* Brief Demo of working software in production - 2 minutes
* Group Interview - 8 minutes
* Individual Interviews - 10 minutes per person
* Grading - 10 minutes

#### 11-Dec: Open Studio
We'll have an open-house and demo day for student projects.
